                <div class="about-description">
                    Greetings! I'm currently on the exciting journey of completing my Bachelor of Information Technology (Hons) with a major in Software Engineering at UNITAR International University, set to graduate in 2026.<br><br>
                
                    Passionate about coding and ever-eager to explore new technologies, I've actively engaged in diverse projects for both self-development and skill enhancement. Despite not having a prior IT/CS background, my journey into programming began with a fascination for Data Science and Python for Data Analytics, sparked by a desire to gain the technical skills to analyze stock market trends after a significant loss.<br><br>
                
                    That interest grew into a love for programming, and now here I am!<br><br>
                    
                    Choosing to major in Software Engineering was fueled by my newfound love for programming. This journey officially started after a career break, where I transitioned from being a Plating Equipment Engineering Specialist at Seagate Technology to pursuing higher education in the tech world.<br><br>
                    
                    My professional journey has covered various roles, ranging from a part-time dropshipper to an intern in Electrical Engineering and a Sales Assistant. However, my commitment to continuous learning and my passion for software engineering guided me to my current pursuit.<br><br>
                    
                    Alongside my academic accomplishments, like making it to the Dean's List at UNITAR International University, I actively contribute to my secondary school's alumni association. Serving as the President and representative for my batch, I work towards strengthening the connection between my batch members and alumni as well as the school.<br><br>
                    
                    As I navigate the world of software engineering, my goal is to keep learning and evolving, always on the lookout for new opportunities and collaborations. I'm also exploring ways to prepare for and participate in hackathons with like-minded individuals. Here's to the exciting journey ahead!

                        Developed a full-stack web application as a coursework project for ITIB2063 Database course. Focusing on user authentication, form handling, and CRUD operations. In a group of four, my major responsibility was to build all the forms that covered system functionalities such as user login, item creation, supplier addition, and item transaction registration. Even though I had little expertise with PHP, I was still able to effectively develop the backend functionality by using my C++ background. Earned an A+ for this course.<br><br>
